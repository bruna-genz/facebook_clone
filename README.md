In this app we created a facebook like application. It has the following functionalities:
- User can create an account or sign up with Facebook;
- Users can make posts;
- Users can like and comment on posts;
- Users can request friendship from others sign up users;
- Users can create chat rooms and talk to other users (see section Future Improvements);
- Functional search bar to find users.

## Acknowledgements

- To create the Friendships we use the following tutorial as reference: https://smartfunnycool.com/friendships-in-activerecord/;
- To the chat: https://iridakos.com/programming/2019/04/04/creating-chat-application-rails-websockets;

## Future improvements:

- Currently, the user has to refresh the page on the chat to display new messages. The goal is to make the chat asynchronous.
